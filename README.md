Edward and I tackled this project very equally. As there were only two of us, we just took turn sharing our respective screens but instead of a driver and guider, we both just
openly discussed our ideas and solutions to any problems we came across. The most difficult part for us was incorporating and building our library but once we figured out the
proper wording and formatting for it, the project came together well.
